######  This repository contains a simple, barebones React widget, illustrating the use of basic React concepts.

This is just a very simple Gallery APP, showing you the images from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

## Prerequisites

First and foremost you will need GIT and Node.js installed on your system:

* [GIT Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

* [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)

## Installation

Start console ([cmd on Windows](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/7-ways-launch-command-prompt-windows-7-windows-8)), and navigate to the directory where you want the code to be cloned to:

```
git clone https://github.com/it-s/react-in-15.git
```
```
cd react-in-15
npm install
```
## Building and running

While still in the console

```
npm run build
```
```
npm run start
```
## How this works

The repository has the following structure:

##### **/html**

###### Don't mind this. It has more to do with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and testing then react itself...

##### **/utils**

###### This directory contains helpful utilities to make working with react a little bit easier

##### **/views**

###### The heart and soul of our APP. This directory contains all the view elements and logic of our simple gallery.
