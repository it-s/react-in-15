######  Site startup template

Don't mind this. It contains an HTML template where the widget is instantiated when you run `npm run start`. It has more to do with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) then react itself...

The only point of interest is the following little snippet:

```
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
</body
```
