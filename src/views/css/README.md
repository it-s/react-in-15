######  Styles for our application, and it's various components

Some of the custom styles our APP is using. This is not React specific. It has more to do with the CSS transformer feature of Babel. You can learn more about it here.

To include a CSS file into your component you just need to add the following to the component's definition file top:

```
import "./[path to css]/[css file name].css";
```
##### **app.css**

###### Base styles for our gallery

##### **filter.css**

###### Styles for gallery filter component

##### **footer.css**

###### Footer component styles (literally nothing).

##### **gallery.css**

###### The styles for our main gallery component
