# /UTILS

######  Helpful utilities to make working with react a little bit easier

## ./client.js:

A helpful wrapper for [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) making it a little bit less verbose

## ./config.js:

Just a simple JS Object containing some configuration params for the app (actually just a pointer to the [unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) at the moment).

## ./index.js

Don't mind this. It's just an exporter for all the components in this directory. You will see plenty of these all around the project. All they do is tell our [transpiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) what this directory contains.
